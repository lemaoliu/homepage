# Welcome to LAT Group
LAT (Language Analysis and Translation) is a group at NLP Center, Tencent AI Lab. The mission of LAT group is to make machines understand natural language and bridge the gaps between two different languages. 

## Research Fields

- Natural Language Analysis and Understanding: theories and algorithms for morphology, syntax and semantics.
- (Neural) Machine Translation: Models, Algorithms, Interpretability etc.
- Interactive Machine Translation: Interactive methods, models and evaluation metrics. 


## News
- 2020/04: A text understanding system [TexSmart](https://texsmart.qq.com) is released.  
- 2018/11: A computer aided translation system [TranSmart](https://transmart.qq.com) is released.
